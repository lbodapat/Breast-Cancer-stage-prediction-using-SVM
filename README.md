# Breast-Cancer-stage-prediction-using-SVM

This project has 5 steps:
1. Data cleaning.
2. Exploratory Data analyis(EDA)
3. Pre-processing using Principal component Analysis(PCA)
4. Classfication using Support vector machines classifier(SVM)
5. Optimizing the classifier to improve accuracy.

The Dataset in this project is obtained from Breast cancer data set from the UCI repository. The dataset is also attached to this repository.

Graphs and plots have been drawn where necessary.
